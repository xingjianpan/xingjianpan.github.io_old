  <article class="post-content">
  <p>The book caught my attention when I was looking for a book that can get me started with just enough project management skills. I was working on an internal project at that time. After comparing a few books on project management, I think this one is the best one with <strong>just enough</strong> things i need to know to get through.</p>

<p>I’d recommend this book to anyone who has few experience in project management and need to manage a project by herself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You want just enough to get the job done. Nothing more.</p>
</blockquote>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What make a project?
 	* It has a <strong>start and end</strong>; it doesn’t go on forever.
 	* It’s focused on achieving an <strong>outcome</strong>.
 	* It involves putting together a sequence of steps that goes from the start to the end and creates the outcome.
 	* It might have a budget, an amount of money set aside to cover the the costs.
 	* It may require a team of people to work on it or it could just be you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>What is project management?
    <ul>
