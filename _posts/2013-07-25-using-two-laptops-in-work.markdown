I have recently switched to using two laptops in work, and I feel this is a great move, I am able to be more focused, more productive, and less time wasted on keep everything in sync.


### What's my situation
1. My work laptop is a Dell Latitude E6410, I have been using it for 3 years and it recently get upgraded to Win 7. It's a standard business laptop. It can do the work, but it feels quite slow and there is not much joy using it. 
2. I spent quite a lot time on writing code in python and I am the admin of two internal websites which are built in a linux box. I am more comfortable using linux-like systems instead of Windows.
3. However, I also need to use a lot of Microsoft Softwares, like Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, sharepoints, Webex,  Microsoft SQL server, etc. 
4. I can not simply moving to MacOS or Linux, because all my colleagues are using Windows as their primary system.



### What problems I have
1. Windows is not very suitable for developing websites with python. Many libraries that can be easily installed on linux may require a lot of small fixes or workaround to get it work on Windows.
2. It's hard to switch tools, like IDE.
3. Working on MBP is easier for developing, but it's difficult to use business softwares.


### My solutions
1. Bring my MacBook Pro to work.
2. Use company laptop for mails, and necessary business softwares.
3. Everything else on macbook pro. including coding, writing things.
4. Use [Baidu Yun](http://yun.baidu.com) to keep in sync.


### Feeling after using two laptops for a week
1. I feel more focused and more productive.
2. I spent less time worrying about syncing files.
3. I spent less time to fix things that doesn't work on windows.
4. Bonus:I looks cooler cause I am the only one using a Mac in the office :)
