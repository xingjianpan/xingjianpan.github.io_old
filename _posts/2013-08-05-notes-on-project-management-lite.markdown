The book caught my attention when I was looking for a book that can get me started with just enough project management skills. I was working on an internal project at that time. After comparing a few books on project management, I think this one is the best one with __just enough__ things i need to know to get through.

I'd recommend this book to anyone who has few experience in project management and need to manage a project by herself.


>You want just enough to get the job done. Nothing more.

## Summary
1. The book tell me how to :
	* clearly define the project and plan.
	* work the plan until it's done.
	* close the project. 
	
2. What make a project?
 	* It has a __start and end__; it doesn't go on forever.
 	* It's focused on achieving an __outcome__.
 	* It involves putting together a sequence of steps that goes from the start to the end and creates the outcome.
 	* It might have a budget, an amount of money set aside to cover the the costs.
 	* It may require a team of people to work on it or it could just be you.
 	
3. What is project management?
	* Project management is simply the a process for __getting things done__.  PM help you define what you need to do, plan it out,and get it done.
	
4. The book's 3-steps to get started with Project management.
	* Define what you are trying to do.
	* Come up with a plan to do it.
	* Work through the plan.

5. SMARTER Technique(Specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic, time bound, ethical, resourced.)

## Plan the project

> Don't do anything you don't' have to do. -Louis Fried


1. Create a clear and focused vision of 
	* what is to be achieved
	* what the general timeframe
	* who needs to be involved
	* what overall budget.
2. project sponsor - the person who is asking the the project to be completed.





### Define what you are trying to do(1)

1. What's the goal or outcome of the project?
	* use SMARTER to set goal.
2. Why it's important?
3. What are the critical constraints, if any?
4. When does it need to be complete? and what's "complete"?
5. What do you have in mind for a budget?
6. What features must be included at the absolute minimums so that the project can still be considered successful?
7. What things must be produced for the project to be considered successful?
8. What key events are needed to ensure the project is progressing as planned?
9. Are you aware of anything that could go wrong? If somethings does, what should be done about it?
10. Who can help with the planning?
11. Who will be impacted? What will the impact be and how should we handle it?
	* these people are also called stakeholders.
	* they can be positively/negatively impacted by the project.
12. Who has a strong personal interest in the project?
13. Who needs to know what's going on with the project.

### Get this one right:
1. Project charter defines what you're going to do
2. The plan defines how you're going to do it.
3. Review the information with the sponsor and get approval to continue.

	
### Come up with a plan to do it.(2)
1. How to set up a plan?
	* See if it's been done before.
	* Brainstorm. 
	* Mind map.
	
2. How to calculate actual efforts and project duration?
	* The task takes four hours. A person is assigned on this and spend 1 hour per week, in total it takes 4 weeks.

## Work the plan

1. Get an agenda 
2. Schedule the meeting.
3. Hold the meeting
4. Distribute the meeting minutes.

### Make sure the the work gets done. (4)

2. You review what was supposed to be achieved and check off if these tasks were done or not.
3. you should ask what exactly has been done, what specially remains to be done, and how long it's going to take until it's done.
