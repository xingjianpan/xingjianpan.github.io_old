## What this book about?

## The first shock from this book.

1. People now get used to the habits of using toothpaste to brush their teeth, but this habit doesn't exist for majority people in the world 50 years ago. A clever advertiser actually build this habit for the rest of the people to help selling the toothpaste.
2. It's said using toothpaste is not really useful at all. But people like the cool feeling when using toothpaste and this reminds them they have done a routine.
2. Not just toothpaste, many things that are now _considered a necesssary_ in original people's shopping cart, are _not_ common 50 or 100 years go.  Economics development is an imporant factor. But we should ask ourselves, how we come to the habit of using them? 
3. People developed the habits of using something and then feel it's a necessary. 


## Why the book is useful for me?
1. it actually make it clear, habit, like many things else, can be _developed_. 
2. Individual can use the same techinque to develop _good_ habits that can make their life better.
3. Once the habit is there, it actually works by itself. People who has the habit to get up earlier don't consider it a pain to get up earlier anymore, as it become their habit.


## Why the book is useful for corporates?
1. Like individuals, companies also have their habits.
2. By developing a powerful and healthy habit, a company can realize substantial competitive advantage over oters.
3. The book give out a great example. CEO Paul O'Neill set the habit of alwasy string for 0 injuries for the company, which turns out to change a lot of things.



## How to develop a habit?
1.  Find a Cue - a trigger for doing something.
2.  Routine - what actually get done.
3.  Reward - positive feedback if done.
4.  Craving for reward - the hidded force. This is the driving force behind every good or bad habit. it's important find find the craving.


## Not all habits are created equal
1. a few habits, also knowns as _keynote habit_ play a much important role than other habits.
2. By focusing on developing one or two _keynote habit_, it's said other habits, usually good ones, will naturally come.
3. An example of such _keynote habits_ is daily exercise.
